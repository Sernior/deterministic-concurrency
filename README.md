## About The Project

Concurrency testing often poses challenges due to the <span style="color: darkgoldenrod;">non-deterministic</span> nature of threads and synchronization mechanisms. The `DeterministicConcurrency` library aims to address these challenges by providing tools to create and manage deterministic concurrency scenarios, enabling precise and reliable testing.<br />
While primarily designed for testing, the `UserControlledScheduler` can also serve as a framework to create synchronized thread pool-like structures for broader multithread applications.

The assumptions are:
  - `UserControlledScheduler` automatically creates a number of `std::thread` equal to the number of arguments you pass its constructor; these <span style="color: darkgoldenrod;">threads</span> are lazy and each one of them must be allowed to terminate by the `UserControlledScheduler`. 
  - To allow a <span style="color: darkgoldenrod;">thread</span> to finish, the `UserControlledScheduler` must allow these <span style="color: darkgoldenrod;">threads</span> to proceed until they are in a <span style="color: darkgoldenrod;">joinable</span> state.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

I build and tested this lib with C++17.
If for some reason, on some compilers, it doesn`t work on C++17+ please email me or open an issue.
### Setup
This is an header only library but you can build the `main.cpp` which contains a simple test using:

   ```sh
   $ cmake . -B build -DDC_COMPILE_MAIN=ON -G Ninja
   ```

   ```sh
   $ cmake --build build
   ```

You can also generate the build files to build the tests with:
   ```sh
   $ cmake . -B build -DDC_COMPILE_TESTS=ON -G Ninja
   ```

### Installation

Using cmake you can include this lib using:
```cmake
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
  dc
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/Sernior/deterministic-concurrency.git
  GIT_TAG [TAG] #change with the tag you want to use
)

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(dc)
```

At this point you should be able to link the library simply using:

``` cmake
target_link_libraries(your_stuff.cpp deterministic_concurrency)
```


## Snippet
This is a snippet ready-to-use.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <DeterministicConcurrency>

void your_function(DeterministicConcurrency::thread_context* c, uint32_t a, uint32_t b) {
    std::cout << "I'm writing " << a << "!\n";
    c->switchContext();
    std::cout << "I'm writing " << b << "!\n";
}

int main()
{
    auto thread_0 = std::tuple{&your_function, 0, 2};
    auto thread_1 = std::tuple{&your_function, 1, 3};
    
    auto sch = DeterministicConcurrency::make_UserControlledScheduler(
            thread_0, thread_1
        );

    sch.switchContextTo(1);
    sch.switchContextTo(0);
    sch.switchContextTo(0);
    sch.switchContextTo(1);

    sch.joinAll();
}
```

The output of the above will be:

```
I'm writing 1!
I'm writing 0!
I'm writing 2!
I'm writing 3!
```
